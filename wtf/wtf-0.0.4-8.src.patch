+WIBGI	Wouldn't It Be Great If... First used on the list by Ronald Landheer-Cieslak

+YANALATEYHSMBSI	You Are Not A Lawyer, And Therefore Everything You Have Said May Be Safely Ignored.  Born out of a heated GPL discussion.  Acronym proposed by Chuck Wilson.  A new standard response to IANAL.  Don't try to pronounce it.  Just... don't
