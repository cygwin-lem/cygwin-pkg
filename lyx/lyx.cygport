NAME="lyx"
VERSION=2.2.0
RELEASE=1

CATEGORY="Publishing Editors Graphics"
DESCRIPTION="A document processor that encourages an approach to writing based
on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It is designed
for people that write and want their writing to look great, right out of
the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, 'finger
painting' font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You just
write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary TeX typesetting engine
makes you look good."
